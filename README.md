# Wine Quality Prediction
## Dataset
The dataset is public on Kaggle with about 6498 entries. They records the data with 11 dimentions including: fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, 
total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, and alcohol. With these data we want to predict the wine quality ranging from 1 to 10 (10 is the best). 

## Data preprocessing 
First we need to check all null data in the file, using '''' print(data.isnull().sum()) ''''
## Data visualization 

## Model choise
